# Gesture Control User Guide

This guide will help you use the webcam-based gesture control system for navigating through the LSU Presentation.

## Quick Start

1. Open the launcher by opening `launch.html` in your web browser
2. Choose either **Demo Mode** or **Presentation Mode**
3. Click the **Enable Gesture Control** button
4. Grant webcam permission when prompted
5. Use hand gestures to navigate through the presentation

## Available Gestures

| Gesture | Action | How to Perform |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Cross Right | Go to next slide | Simply move your hand from the left half of the screen to the right half |
| Cross Left | Go to previous slide | Simply move your hand from the right half of the screen to the left half |
| Hold (if enabled) | Custom action | Keep your hand still for about 1 second |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Proper Lighting**: Ensure your hand is well-lit for better detection
2. **Hand Position**: Keep your hand at a comfortable distance from the camera
3. **Hand Orientation**: Face your palm toward the camera with fingers extended
4. **Center Crossing**: Make sure your hand crosses the center line of the webcam view
5. **Relaxed Movement**: No need for fast or large movements - just cross from one side to the other
6. **Visibility**: Make sure your hand is clearly visible in the webcam view
7. **Background**: A plain background with good contrast to your hand works best
8. **Camera Angle**: Position your webcam to capture a good view of where you'll be making gestures
9. **Practice First**: Try using the demo mode to get comfortable with the controls

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues

If you see a webcam permission error:

1. Check that your browser has permission to access your webcam
2. In Chrome, click the camera icon in the address bar and select "Allow"
3. Try refreshing the page after granting permission
4. Make sure no other applications are using your webcam

### Gesture Detection Problems

If your gestures aren't being detected properly:

1. Make sure your hand is clearly visible in the webcam view
2. Try making more deliberate, slightly slower movements
3. Check that there is enough contrast between your hand and the background
4. Ensure there is adequate lighting so your hand is clearly visible
5. Try adjusting your distance from the camera

### Performance Issues

If the system seems slow or unresponsive:

1. Close other browser tabs or applications that might be using resources
2. Use Chrome or Edge browsers for best compatibility
3. Disable any unnecessary browser extensions
4. If using the debug mode, try disabling it for better performance

## Using the Demo Mode

The Demo Mode is perfect for:

- Testing if your webcam is working correctly
- Practicing gestures before a real presentation
- Understanding how the system detects your hand movements

In Demo Mode, you'll see a simple page with numbered slides. This allows you to easily test the navigation gestures without the content of the full presentation.

## Presenting with Gesture Control

When you're ready to give your actual presentation:

1. Launch the presentation in Presentation Mode
2. Position yourself where your webcam can clearly see your gestures
3. Have the small webcam preview visible to confirm your hand is being tracked
4. Use natural gestures as you present - avoid unnecessarily rapid movements
5. If needed, you can always use keyboard arrows as a backup

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The keyboard shortcuts still work alongside gesture control:

- **Right Arrow** or **Space**: Next slide
- **Left Arrow**: Previous slide

## For Presenters

- **Practice First**: Try the Demo Mode to get comfortable with gestures
- **Have a Backup**: Keep keyboard shortcuts in mind as a fallback
- **Check Setup**: Test the gesture control on the actual presentation device before your talk
- **Be Deliberate**: Make clear, intentional gestures during your presentation
- **Frame Check**: Glance at the webcam preview occasionally to ensure your hand is in frame
- **Avoid Fatigue**: Rest your arm between gestures to avoid tiring during long presentations
