        "Problem:": [
            "Traditional construction education often lacks training in Computational Thinking (CT) needed for modern, technology-driven workplaces involving robotics and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)."
        ],
        "Goal:": [
            "To develop and evaluate a Virtual Reality (VR) training environment designed to integrate CT as a core competency for construction students through immersive HRI scenarios."
        ],
        "Key Research Questions:": [
            "1. How effective is the VR-based HRI training environment in enhancing specific Computational Thinking (CT) competencies (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking) among construction students?",
            "2. What is the impact of the VR training on students' skills (e.g., accuracy, speed, safety) and attitudes (e.g., confidence, persistence) related to robotic construction tasks?",
            "3. How well do skills and CT competencies acquired in the VR training transfer to novel simulated environments (realistic terrestrial and extraterrestrial construction sites)?",
            "4. What relationships exist between CT knowledge, attitudes, and skill performance within this VR training context?"
        ],
        "Approach:": [
            "Developed a VR training environment featuring pick-and-place tasks with a robotic arm on a Mecanum wheel platform.",
            "Created progressive difficulty levels across diverse scenarios (terrestrial/extraterrestrial).",
            "Implemented a Knowledge-Skill-Attitude (KSA) framework for comprehensive assessment."
